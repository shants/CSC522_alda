  # INPUT:
  # Input: train_matrix: type: matrix n_sentences x sentence_length,
  # where n_sentences is total # training rows (100 in the dataset supplied to you) and
  # sentence_length is the total # features (100 in the dataset supplied to you).
  # Input: test_matrix: type: matrix of size 50 x 100 (i.e, 50 rows, 100 features)
  # Input: method_name: type: string, can be one of the following values: ('calculate_euclidean', 'calculate_cosine')
  
  # OUTPUT:
  # output: a 50 x 100 matrix of type double, containing the distance/similarity calculation using method_name between 
  # every row in test to every row in train 
  # This function has already been implemented for you. It takes the data matrix and method name, outputs the distance
  # matrix based on the method name.

  # You will be IMPLEMENTING a KNN Classifier here
  
  # Build a distance matrix by computing the distance between every test sentence 
  # (row in training TF-IDF matrix) and training sentence (row in test TF-IDF matrix).
  # Use the above calculate_distance_matrix function to calculate this distance matrix (code already given to you).
  # You can re-use the calculate_euclidean and calculate_cosine methods from HW1 here.
  # Once the distance matrix is computed, for each row in the distance matrix, calculate the 'k' nearest neighbors
  # and return the most frequently occurring class from these 'k' nearest neighbors.
  
  # INPUT:
  # x_train: TF-IDF matrix with dimensions: (number_training_sentences x number_features)
  # y_train: Vector with length number_training_sentences of type factor - refers to the class labels
  # x_test: TF-IDF matrix with dimensions: (number_test_sentences x number_features)
  # k: integer, represents the 'k' to consider in the knn classifier
  # distance_method: String, can be of type ('calcualte_euclidean' or 'calculate_cosine')
  # OUTPUT:
  # A vector of predictions of length = number of sentences in y_test and of type factor.
  
  # NOTE 1: Don't normalize the data before calculating the distance matrix
  
  # NOTE 2: For cosine, remember, you are calculating similarity, not distance. As a result, K nearest neighbors 
  # k values with highest values from the distance_matrix, not lowest. 
  # For euclidean, you are calculating distance, so you need to consider the k lowest values. 
  
  # NOTE 3:
  # In case of conflicts, choose the class with lower numerical value
  # E.g.: in 5NN, if you have 2 NN of class 1, 2 NN of class 2, and 1 NN of class 3, there is a conflict b/w class 1 and class 2
  # In this case, you will choose class 1. 
  
  # NOTE 4:
  # You are not allowed to use predefined knn-based packages/functions. Using them will result in automatic zero.
  # Allowed packages: R base, utils
